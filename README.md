# Metadata-Title-Updater
Updates the title in the metadata to match the filename.

Very basic script with a simple GUI.

I had a lot of DVDs that I wanted to store in one place and could access easily so I ripped them all onto a drive and used tinyMediaManager to update the names etc.

However I found that the metadata didn't always match the filename and I couldn't find a way to update them en masse. 

Thus, I decided to write a quick script to automate the process and make it less tedious.
